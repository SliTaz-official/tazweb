<h2>TazWeb Browser</h2>

<p>TazWeb is a modern, radically simple and very light web browser providing all
needed functions for daily browsing on the internet. TazWeb is aware of users
privacy, it handles cookies but will NOT store any passwords or other user info.</p>

<p>TazWeb provides a single window with a small toolbar and a contextual 
menu, but without any menubar or tabs. Navigation is done with a right click
anywhere in the browser window or from the toolbar. TazWeb lets you quickly
search the web through a search entry redirecting to a DuckDuck Go secure search
engine. This documentation file is always accessible from the right-click 
menu.</p>

<p>The browser's fast, very fast and small, the binary is about 30 Kb and
uses the WebkitGTK engine for page rendering and therefore supports all the 
latest web standards as well as Javascript and Flash animations or videos.</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>The SliTaz Web Browser was created for the needs of TazPanel which is 
the SliTaz administration and packages manager panel and made with the 
latest technologies such as HTML 5 and CSS 3 for the graphical user interface.
The content is powered by CGI scripts and the preferred web server is 
Busybox httpd.</p>


<h3>Security and private browsing</h3>

<p>TazWeb is a very secure browser and doesn't store any personal data, 
therefore no sessions, passwords or history files are created, but it will
handle cookies by default.
So your websites cookies will save your peer site settings but logins
and passwords will not be saved and you will have to re-enter login information
each time you restart the browser (by the way websites can track you 
with cookies!).</p>

<p>TazWeb provide a private browsing mode which will disable cookies, on-disk
sessions and global histories. You can use the command line option to start
TazWeb in private mode:</p>

<pre>$ tazweb --private</pre>


<h3>Kiosk mode</h3>

<p>TazWeb provides a Kiosk mode useful for computers in public areas.
The Kiosk mode will start TazWeb in fullscreen.
It will not allow users to bookmark a page, download anything or open a URL in a new window.</p>

<pre>$ tazweb --kiosk</pre>


<h3>Raw and minimal mode</h3>

<p>TazWeb has a very modular interface and everything can be disabled
to provide a raw webkit window with no toolbar or menu. It also provides
a command line option to have a small (640x480) window suitable for tiny
web applications. The option --notoolbar and --nomenu can be used to
hide the toolbar and menu; the --raw option will disable both:</p>

<pre>$ tazweb --raw</pre>

<h3>Home Page and bookmarks</h3>

<p>TazWeb handles a home page located in your system wide standard 
configuration directory, the path is: /usr/share/webhome.</p>

<p>The bookmark.txt file is a simple text document with, by default, a 
list of links. You can edit this file with you favorite editor and add 
bookmark entries or use the Tazweb right click menu. At first start 
TazWeb will create and copy your personal bookmarks file to your config
directory.</p>

<p>Bookmarks can be handled by TazWeb and you can easily add a bookmark
to your home page with the right click menu item: <i>“Add a bookmark”</i>.
Tazweb also lets you manage your bookmarks via a nifty CGI web interface.</p>

<p>Note: You can find the default bookmarks.txt in: /usr/share/tazweb 
or you can get an original copy with the following command in a terminal:</p>

<pre>
$ cp -f /usr/share/tazweb/bookmarks.txt $HOME/.config/tazweb
</pre>


<h3>Start page and URL in argument</h3>

<p>The default start page has been defined in the source code and can't be changed and is the
default SliTaz WebHome but TazWeb accepts a URL as a first argument, you can for example
execute:</p>

<pre>
$ tazweb <a href="http://www.slitaz.org/">http://www.slitaz.org/</a>
</pre>

<p>In this way you can for example create your own and custom home page in a pretty HTML document
and start tazweb with a standard desktop file or from the command line:
tazweb file://$HOME/.config/tazweb/home.html.</p>

<p>If you want a custom start page for your Live system or all system users, you can create your
own slitaz-configs package or edit the HTML file located in /usr/share/webhome/index.html.
If you modify it, make sure to block slitaz-configs or make a backup because it will be overwritten
with a slitaz-configs package update.</p>

<p>When you start TazWeb from the cmdline with a URL in the argument you don’t have to put http://
since TazWeb will transform URLs for you.</p>


<h3>URL and search entry</h3>

<p>The URL entry in the toolbar lets you enter a website address and shows
the current website location. You can use selection, copy and paste in the 
URL entry and don't have to put http:// before a location, Tazweb will 
transform URLs for you. To activate a new URL you must press ENTER.</p>

<p>The search entry lets you search the web at any time using DuckDuck go.
Just enter your query and press ENTER or click on the entry icon to 
validate your request.</p>


<h3>Web applications</h3>

<p>TazWeb browser is perfect to launch web applications via a simple desktop file.
Once created with a simple text editor, the desktop file can stand on the desktop with a nice icon
or in the standard SliTaz menu.
Example of a web application launcher that you could name scn.desktop:</p>

<pre>
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=SliTaz SCN
Icon=slitaz-menu
Exec=tazweb --notoolbar http://scn.slitaz.org/
</pre>
