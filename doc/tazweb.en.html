<h2>SliTaz Web Browser</h2>

<p>
	TazWeb is a radically simple and very light web browser providing a
	single window with a small toolbar and a contextual menu, but without
	any menubar or tabs. Navigation is done with a right click anywhere in
	the browser window or from the toolbar. It also handle bookmarks in a
	personnal home page, provide a source view mode, zoom and printing
	functions. TazWeb let you quickly search the web throught the search
	entry and Google. This documentation file is always accessible from the
	right-hand side. 
</p>
<p>
	The browser fast, very fast and is small, very small, the binary is about
	24 Kb and uses the Webkit engine for page rendering and therefore supports 
	all latest web standards as well as Javascript and Flash animations or
	videos.
</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>
	The SliTaz Web Browser was created for the needs of TazPanel which is
	the SliTaz administration and packages manager panel and made with 
	the latest technologies such as xHTML 5 and CSS 3 for the graphical
	user interface. The content is powered by CGI scripts and the prefered
	web server is Busybox httpd.
</p>

<h3>Security and personnal data</h3>
<p>
	TazWeb is a very secure browser and it dont store any personnal data,
	no session, cookie or history file is created. So you can't have your
	websites settings saved and will have to enter login information each
	time you restart the browser, but by the way websites can track you
	with cookies!
</p>

<h3>My Home Page and bookmarks</h3>
<p>
	TazWeb handles a personal page located in your Freedesktop standard
	configuration directory, the path is: $HOME/.config/tazweb/home.html.
	It lets you have a custom page with bookmarks and other content. The
	CSS style is defined in $HOME/.config/tazweb/style.css.
</p>
<p>
	The file is a simple xHTML 5 document with, by default, a list of
	links and a box. You can edit this file with you favorite editor
	and add content such as bookmarks entries or change the look and
	feel as you want. At first start TazWeb will create and copy your
	personal page and style to your config directory.
</p>
<p>
	To add some life to your pages you can use your own Javascript
	widgets or some from a third party website such as the famous
	<a href="http://twitter.com/about/resources/widgets">
	Twitter Widget</a> as seen on the SliTaz main website.
</p>
<p>
	Bookmarks can be handled by TazWeb and you can easily add a bookmark to
	your home page with the right click menu item: "Add a bookmark". To work
	TazWeb use a markup in your home.html document, this markup should not
	be removed if you want bookmarking to work since each new item will be
	add just before the line: &gt;!-- end:bookmarks --&lt;
</p>
<p>
	Note: You will find the default home.html in: /usr/share/tazweb and
	can get an original copy with the following commands in a terminal:
</p>
<pre>
$ cp -r /usr/share/tazweb $HOME/.config/tazweb
</pre>

<h3>Start page and url in argument</h3>

<p>
	The default start page has been defined in the source code and can't be
	changed and is the default SliTaz WebHome, but TazWeb accepts an URL as
	a first argument, you can for example execute:
</p>
<pre>
$ tazweb <a href="http://www.slitaz.org/">http://www.slitaz.org/</a>
</pre>
<p>
	In this way you can for example create your own and custom home page in
	a pretty xHTML document and start tazweb with a standard desktop file or
	from the command line: tazweb file://$HOME/.config/tazweb/home.html.
</p>
<p>
	If you want a custom start page for your Live system or all system users,
	you can create your own slitaz-configs package or edit the xHTML file
	located in /usr/share/webhome/index.html. If you modify it, make sure
	to block slitaz-configs or make a backup because it will be overwritten
	with a slitaz-configs package update.
</p>
<p>
	When you stat TazWeb from the cmdline with an URL in argument, you dont
	have to put http:// since TazWeb will transform URL's for you.
</p>

<h3>URL and search entry</h3>
<p>
	The URL entry in the toolbar let you enter a website address and shows
	the current website location. You can use selection, copy and paste in
	the URL entry and dont have to put http:// before a location, Tazweb
	will transform URL's for you. To activation a new URL you must press
	ENTER.
</p>
<p>
	The search entry let you search the web at anytime using Google. Just
	enter you query and press ENTER or click on the entry icon to valide
	your request.
</p>

<h3>Web applications</h3>
<p>
	TazWeb browser is perfect to launch web applications via a simple
	desktop file. Once created with a simple text editor, the desktop
	file can stand on the desktop with a nice icon or in the standard
	SliTaz menu. Example of a web application launcher that you could
	name scn.desktop:
</p>
<pre>
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=SliTaz SCN
Icon=slitaz-menu
Exec=tazweb http://scn.slitaz.org/
</pre>
