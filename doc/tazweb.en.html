<h2>SliTaz Web Browser</h2>

<p>
	TazWeb is radically simple and very light web browser providing a
	single window with a small toolbar, but without any menubar or tabs. 
	Navigation is done with a right click anywhere in the browser window 
	or from the toolbar. Also a fullscreen mode, bookmarks, home page
	and this documentation file are accessible from the right-hand side
	of the toolbar.
</p>
<p>
	SliTaz Web Browser was created for the needs of TazPanel which is
	the SliTaz administration and packages manager panel and made with 
	the latest technologies such as xHTML 5 and CSS 3 for the graphical
	user interface. The content is powered by CGI scripts and the prefered
	web server is Busybox httpd.
</p>
<p>
	The browser is small, very small, the binary is about 12 Kb and
	uses the Webkit engine for page rendering and therefore, supports 
	all latest web standards as well as Javascript.
</p>

<h3>Bookmarks</h3>
<p>
	TazWeb can handle a bookmarks file located in your Freedesktop standard
	configuration directory, the path is: $HOME/.config/tazweb/bookmarks.html
</p>
<p>
	The file is a simple xHTML 5 document with, by default, a list of links.
	You can edit this file with you favorite editor and add bookmarks entries
	or change the look and feel as you want. You will find the default
	bookmarks.html in: /usr/share/tazweb. You can get an original copy
	with the following commands in a terminal:
</p>
<pre>
$ mkdir -p $HOME/.config/tazweb
$ cp /usr/share/tazweb/bookmarks.html $HOME/.config/tazweb
</pre>


<h3>Home page and url in argument</h3>

<p>
	The default start page has been defined in the source code and can't be
	changed and is the default SliTaz WebHome, but TazWeb accepts an
	URL as a first argument, example: http://www.slitaz.org/. In this way
	you can for example create your own and custom home page in a pretty
	xHTML document and start tazweb with a standard desktop file or from
	the command line: tazweb file://$HOME/.config/tazweb/home.html
</p>
<p>
	If you want a custom home page for your Live system or all system users,
	you can create your own slitaz-configs package or edit the xHTML file
	located in /usr/share/webhome/index.html. If you modify it, make sure
	to block slitaz-configs or make a backup because it will be overwritten
	with a slitaz-configs package update.
</p>

<h3>Web applications</h3>
<p>
	TazWeb browser is perfect to launch web applications via a simple
	desktop file. Once created with a simple text editor, the desktop
	file can stand on the desktop with a nice icon or in the standard
	SliTaz menu. Example of a web application launcher that you could
	name scn.desktop:
</p>
<pre>
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=SliTaz SCN
Icon=slitaz-menu
Exec=tazweb http://scn.slitaz.org/
</pre>
