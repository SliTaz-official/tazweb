TazWeb - SliTaz Web Browser
================================================================================


TazWeb is radically simple and very light web browser provinding a single
window without any toolbar, menubar or tabs. Please keep the code simple
and clean, if you are motivated and want to add some entry in the context
menu, please talk to the AUTHOR before commiting anything in the repo.

This application have been crated for Tazpanel and future SliTaz integrated
Web applications. The goal is by far to have a full featured web browser. But
if you have a way to provind a simple plugins mechanism, it would be great.

In the src/ directory you find a version of tazweb with a toolbar for a
go-home, go-back, go-next, url entry. The idea with TazWeb is to dont
have a toolbar by default, but we could have one in option from the
context menu or the cmdline: tazweb --toolbar. Or just, some button
icons in the right left of the screen for go-home, go back and go-next.
That said, the aproach is to build all the GUI with xHTML and CSS like
in TazPanel.

For general and end-user documentation have a look at doc/tazweb.html.
TazWeb is published, like webkit source under a free BSD license

BUG: When right on on link the "Open Link in New Window dont work 


Build and install
-----------------
TazWeb depends on GTK and libwebkit. To build and test, simply:

$ make
$ ./tazweb

For the version with a toolbar:

$ make toolbar
$ ./tazweb-toolbar

Install with 'make install' (PREFIX and DESTDIR are supported for packaging)
