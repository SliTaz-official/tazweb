TazWeb - SliTaz Web Browser
================================================================================


TazWeb is radically simple and very light web browser provinding a single
window with one small bottom toolbar, but no menubar or tabs. Please keep
the code simple and clean, if you are motivated and want to add some entry
in the context menu, please talk to the AUTHOR before commiting anything
in the repo.

This application have been crated for Tazpanel and future SliTaz integrated
Web applications. The goal is by far to have a full featured web browser. But
if you have a way to provinde a simple plugins mechanism, it would be great.

The idea with TazWeb is to have a minimal interface, the aproache is to
build all the GUI with xHTML and CSS like in TazPanel.

For general and end-user documentation have a look at doc/tazweb.html.
TazWeb is published, like webkit source under a free BSD license

BUG: When right on on link the "Open Link in New Window dont work 


Build and install
-----------------
TazWeb depends on GTK and libwebkit. To build and test, simply:

$ make
$ ./tazweb

For the version with a toolbar:

$ make toolbar
$ ./tazweb-toolbar

Install with 'make install' (PREFIX and DESTDIR are supported for packaging)


URL in the toolbar
------------------
Like said above Tazweb must keep a simple interface and only one small toolbar
with a few buttons. In the first stage of the project I hesitate to put an URL
entry in the bar, but finally came to the conclusion that it is not usefull and
not the goal of tazweb. But here is the code for posterity:

static GtkWidget* uri_entry;

static void
activate_uri_entry_cb (GtkWidget* entry, gpointer data)
{
	const gchar* uri = gtk_entry_get_text (GTK_ENTRY (entry));
	g_assert (uri);
	webkit_web_view_load_uri (web_view, uri);
}

/* The URL entry */
item = gtk_tool_item_new ();
gtk_tool_item_set_expand (item, TRUE);
uri_entry = gtk_entry_new ();
gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (item), uri_entry);
g_signal_connect (G_OBJECT (uri_entry), "activate",
	G_CALLBACK (activate_uri_entry_cb), NULL);
gtk_toolbar_insert (GTK_TOOLBAR (toolbar), item, -1);
