TazWeb - SliTaz Web Browser
================================================================================


TazWeb is a radically simple and very light web browser providing a single
window with one small bottom toolbar using buttons, an URL and search entry,
and a contextual menu but no menubar or tabs. Please keep the code simple
and clean, if you are motivated and want to add some more functionality, 
please talk to the AUTHOR before commiting anything in the repos.

TazWeb uses a custom page in the user Freedesktop directory to let users add
any content to it and get with one click from the toolbar. We may have
an external apps/script to handle that file for users who can't manage to
edit pure xHTML.

This application have been created for Tazpanel and future SliTaz integrated
Web applications. The goal is by far to have a fully-featured web browser. But
if you find a way to provide a simple plugins mechanism, that would be great.

The idea with TazWeb is to have a minimal interface, the approach is to
build all the GUI with xHTML and CSS like in TazPanel.

For general and end-user documentation have a look at doc/tazweb.html.
TazWeb is published, like webkit source under a free BSD license.

BUG: Right clicking on "Open Link in New Window" is connecting to an event
but doesn't work.


Build and install
-----------------
TazWeb depends on GTK and libwebkit. To build and test, simply:

$ make
$ ./tazweb

Generate translation files:

$ make msgfmt

Install with 'make install' (PREFIX and DESTDIR are supported for packaging).


Coding notes
------------
    * To get the filename of a WebKitDownload:
      file = webkit_download_get_suggested_filename (download);
      
    * Check mime-type before download (needs a callback function)
      g_signal_connect (web_view, "mime-type-policy-decision-requested",
              G_CALLBACK (mime_type_decision_cb), webview);

    * Get user config directory path in $HOME:
      config = g_strdup_printf ("%s/.config/tazweb", g_get_home_dir ());

    * Change font of a widget:
      PangoFontDescription *font;
      font = pango_font_description_from_string("8");
      gtk_widget_modify_font(urientry, font);
      pango_font_description_free(font);

    * Change size of a widget:
      gtk_widget_set_size_request(toolbar, 0, 28);

    * Append a string
      g_string_append(string, " - TazWeb");

    * Editable webview
      webkit_web_view_set_editable (webview, TRUE);


i18n
----
Internationalization of TazWeb was introduced since version 1.6.4.
It's standard GLib technique described in developer notes:
http://developer.gnome.org/glib/2.32/glib-I18N.html

Translation template (tazweb.pot) and all translations (xx.po) contained
in the po/ folder. To start a new translation use msginit from the
po/ directory. Example for French/France locale (fr_FR):

$ msginit -l fr_FR -o fr.po -i tazpanel.pot

If you run msginit directly without any parameters, locale settings of your
system will be used.

To update pot file from a newly updated sources:

$ make pot

To update all translations from a newly updated pot file:

$ make msgmerge

To clear the distro from temporary compiled and generated files:

$ make clean
