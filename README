TazWeb - SliTaz Web Browser
================================================================================


TazWeb is radically simple and very light web browser providing a single
window with one small bottom toolbar with buttons and URL entry, but no
menubar or tabs. Please keep the code simple and clean, if you are
motivated and want to add some entries to the context menu, please talk
to the AUTHOR before commiting anything in the repos.

TazWeb use a custom page in user Freedesktop directory to let user add
any content in it and get with one click from the toolbar. We may have
a external apps/script to handle that file for user who dont manage to
edit pure xHTML.

This application have been created for Tazpanel and future SliTaz integrated
Web applications. The goal is by far to have a fully-featured web browser. But
if you find a way to provide a simple plugins mechanism, that would be great.

The idea with TazWeb is to have a minimal interface, the approach is to
build all the GUI with xHTML and CSS like in TazPanel.

For general and end-user documentation have a look at doc/tazweb.html.
TazWeb is published, like webkit source under a free BSD license.

BUG: Right clicking on "Open Link in New Window" doesn't work.


Build and install
-----------------
TazWeb depends on GTK and libwebkit. To build and test, simply:
